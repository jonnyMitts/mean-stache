Intro
=======================
	
	* What is the problem with the Dr. Appointment experience in the present
		*Clinical - this word makes you think of a cold impersonal experience. Long waiting times and care salesman replies
		*Consumption - both time and mind, Dr. Appointments can lead to intrusion in you work/life schedule but also depending on the situation really tap someone from a mental standpoint.
		*Cumbersome - From insurance to office office hours there are a lot of roadblocks in scheduling a simple procedure

	* Current ways of elliciating the Dr. office intrusion.
		* Fill in paper work prior to visit
			* The problem is you have to do this with ever Dr.

Scene 1
=======================

	Depending on what ailment we go with this script will change. I am going with Hadi and sinus pressure
	
	* Nararrator: waking up sick nowadays is just an intrusion nowadays. In a fast paced world playing phone tag with a providers answering service can be so annoying that you don't want to deal with it.
	* Actor: Sneezes makes a face that shows discontent, picks up the phone and calls the doctor after using Siri unsuccesfully twice he/she gets a valid number.
	* Narrarator: points out that patients are captive to office staff.
	* Actor: decides to open "@App Name@" and pick from past providers to apply for an appointment. He/she gets the available appointments and gets a dialog to fill in a small synopsis of symptoms. This journey is over for the moment
	* Narrarator: Fast forward we are at the Dr. office and you can check in 1 of 2 ways:
		*In the app click checkin and we can show the office "leaderboard" update realtime
		*I have also procured a touchscreen so we can use that as an in office alternative. You would click the your username and get a modal that asks for your app password. That will allow for you checkin without device and quickly

	**Gap : There would have to be a signal for the patient to go to office and once there alert the nurse.

Scene 2
=========================
	This scene will show the actual personal contact is not lost in only that visit everything is captured and communicated throughout the visit.

	* Nararrator: Now the ill patient is sitting in the exam room waiting on the nurse, he she has a couple of symptoms to add. 
	* Actor: Holding neck and sneezing, the nurse enters and asks all pertinent questions for the visit. The nurse leaves and submits their notes, 
	* Actor: The device that the doctor is using is updated with both notification and order. 
		*Order can change if one nurse is making rounds faster than others. This will lead to a more effecient office.

Scene 3
==========================
	This scene the dr will enter and as his/her questions. He/she will add notes and also resources to the visit record.

	*Nararrator: The doctor enters the room
	*Dialogue: the patient/doctor dialogue is a short simple conversation. its points are added to the record. The doctor highlights the resources and adds them to the record. He also adds prescription that is posted to the pharmacy you have filerd in the app. The patient navigated the app and sees that the app is updated

Pre-summary
========================
	At this point we have conquered different parts of the of the problem c's.
		*Clinical - Solutions
			*We have removed a lot of the office visit and moved it to the patients terms. Close to intant feedback on appointment times. Instant transmition of patient information via app. Office would need to be on the system.
			* You can update you're symptoms via app so there is no talking to strangers in the office.

		*Compsumption
			*Time
				*All preffered doctors are stored and there is easy access to appointments. No searches for numbers, no answering services. No waiting in line.
			*Mentally
				* Though there is nothing that can brighten a bad diagnosis, waiting is the worst part of a visit where you are awaiting results. Killing consumtion of time helps the overall experience and helps with the stress of a bad medical situation.

		*Cumbersome
			* In a day and age of shallow job oppurtunities and overwork things slip through the cracks. Being able to create appointments have real time access to medical records is invaluable. Does anyone know the last time they got shots? unless they had to go to India! ZING!

Full Circle
==========================

	Sapient emplyee is working feverishly because his deadline had been moved up 9 days and he/she found out this morning. He she knows that they can finish they need  20 extra minutes. The problem is the project has been pushed to the point that is close with hard deadline and an important dr appointment. Because the app is able to track schedule against actual office time the sapient employee recieves a messeg that their appointment has been pushed 30 minutes. Sapient employee makes a cheezy smile because the app has helped them not waste time and the stress relief is a health benefit.
